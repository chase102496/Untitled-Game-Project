Here's how the project's organized
	and how to use this framework:

- All the configs are located at __NetworkingConfig script
- objClient initiates the connection
- When objClient gets a packet, it passes it to handlePacket() function,
  which you can modify
- network_write() sends the specified data (in struct format) to server
- you can write simple wrappers for outcoming signals and put those into SendStuff script
  e.x. you can replace `network_write({cmd: "Hello", msg: "World"})` with `sendHello()`


TL;DR:
- handle input in HandlePacket() script
- handle output using network_write()
- change ip/port in __NetworkingConfig (or input it in-game somehow)
- don't worry about internal stuff too much

- best practice would to define all your
  sending functions in SendStuff script,
  even tho you can just send() things
